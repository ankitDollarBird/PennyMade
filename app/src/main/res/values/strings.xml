    <string name="town_of_knaresborough">
        The town of Knaresborough has plenty to offer visitors, particularly on warm summer days.  It makes a good base to explore the Yorkshire Dales and cities of York and Leeds.\n\n

I can recommend a good hotel and also a very good B. &amp; B. both in Knaresborough town centre, also several good pubs.  \n\n
